This is a GNU Guix /channel/ for the Common Workflow Language which
can be installed on any Linux distribution (Guix is distribution
agnostic).

We also provide a ready made Docker container so you can run without
GNU Guix.

* How to use

** With Docker

tbd

** With GNU Guix

Create or modify the =~/.config/guix/channels.scm= file so it includes

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(cons (channel
        (name 'guix-cwl)
        (url "https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-cwl.git")
        (branch "master"))
      %default-channels)
#+END_SRC

Then run ~guix pull~ as usual. A =cwl= package is available:

: guix package -A cwl

* Requirements

  * Guix > 0.15 (for the "channels" feature)

* Notice

This channel exists because not all dependencies are ready to go into
GNU Guix trunk. We ought to make CWL part of GNU Guix proper in time.
